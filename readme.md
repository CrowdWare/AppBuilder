# AppBuilder
AppBuilder is a content management system targeted for mobile phones.
It uses a native app written in C++ for high performance and renders content based on QML (Qt Markup Language).
So the end result will be a native app with dynamic content.
See it as Web 3.0.

# Administration
There will be also a native desktop app for administration. 
So this will be one of the fastes CMS on the planet, because we skip the roundtrip to the server each time we change a page or each time we add an image.
And on the webserver the content will be presented as static pages....no runtime on the server will be required.
Dynamic content like database queries can be made via AJAX.
